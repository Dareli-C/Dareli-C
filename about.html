      <h2>HI! Nice to Meet You!</h2>
      <p>Hello. My name is Dareli and I made this website during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. I decided to talk mental health and mental illness as my cause because these are subjects that should be talked about more openly. I think that people should be able to reach out if they are not feeling well mentally and not be ashamed about it. Stay Positive!</p>
